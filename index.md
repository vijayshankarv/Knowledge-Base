CrowdAIâ€™s educational vision is to become a great open access learning resource
for data analysis and machine learning. To make this happen, we are launching
the CrowdAI Knowledge Base, a place where everyone in the community comes together to build high quality resources to help data scientists at all levels of expertise,
from beginners to experts.

 In this tutorial we will focus on the
[PlantVillage Classification Challenge](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/1)
hosted on [CrowdAI](https://www.crowdai.org).   

The goal of the challenge is to classify a set of images of plant leaves into 38 possible crop-disease pairs.
Here are a few examples from across all the 38 crop-disease pairs represented in the PlantVillage dataset.

In the following sections we will walk through the basic steps of how to get started on this problem, and similar Image Classification problems using [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/), a very powerful and popular [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) framework developed by [Berkley Vision and Learning Center](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu/).
