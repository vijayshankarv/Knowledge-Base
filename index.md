CrowdAIâ€™s educational vision is to become a great open access learning resource
for data analysis and machine learning. To make this happen, we are launching
the CrowdAI Knowledge Base, a place where everyone in the community comes together to build high quality resources to help data scientists at all levels of expertise,
from beginners to experts.

 In this tutorial we will focus on the
[PlantVillage Classification Challenge](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/1)
hosted on [CrowdAI](https://www.crowdai.org).
