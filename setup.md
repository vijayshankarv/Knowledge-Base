## Environment

This tutorial is built around [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/), and the instructions to install caffe can be found at : [http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html)

Given that we will be using a *Transfer Learning* based approach, **the requirement of a GPU is not strict**, and all the instructions will work perfectly well on any modern and general purpose laptop or desktop. If you do not have a GPU on your laptop or desktop, make sure to build Caffe in *CPU only* mode.   

Unfortunately Windows is not officially supported by Caffe, but there are a few unofficial Windows ports of Caffe listed on the above mentioned installation page. Instructions for Windows users to replicate this tutorial will be added soon.
